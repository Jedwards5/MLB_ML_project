# MLB_ML_project
Use real-world historical MLB data to model a variety of outcomes (some I'm sure I'll figure out later)

Data from Kaggle's "Baseball Databank" including players, teams, and games from 1871 to 2015. End state: scrape or API connection to pull current era data but this is a start & a chance to learn some baseball-specific data
